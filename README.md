[AGiXT](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT) Light Hub for Open Source AGiXT Providers, Extensions, Chains, Prompts, and Agents.

This repository will remain light weight to require the least amount of additional packages.  It will serve as a great baseline for anyone creating their own custom hubs, or use the [AGiXT Hub](https://github.com/AGiXT/hub) with all open source extensions as a starting point.


## Getting Started

- If you don't already have AGiXT, [follow this link for instructions to set it up.](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT#quick-start-guide)
- Modify your `.env.example` file for AGiXT to change the `AGIXT_HUB` variable, this should be `AGiXT/light-hub` if you want to use the light weight Open Source AGiXT hub (this). If you want to use your own fork of AGiXT hub, change this to your username and the name of your fork.
